        <p>SnowCamp is an event that gathers 250 developers on innovation and development (Web, Mobile, Java, Cloud, IoT…) for a 1-day of University on the 8th of February, and a 2-days Conference on the 9th and 10th of February 2017 in Grenoble (French Alps), followed by an skiing "unconference" on the 11th.</p>
        <h3 class="ui header">... dedicated to the innovation</h3>
        <p>This technical conference targets developers and researchers, mixing them to foster innovation.
           The keynote will feature lightning talks (5 minutes) where researchers and PhD students will present their research topics.</p>

        <h3 class="ui header">A city of excellence</h3>
        <p>Since the early stage of electricity, Grenoble has been a place of
          innovation: laboratories and industries at the forefront of technology have
          established themselves there, it was ranked #5 most innovative city in the
          world by Forbes magazine and it is now labelled “French Tech” as a
          recognition of its technical leadership in France. In Grenoble, innovation
          dug its roots in the surrounding mountains. That’s why the SnowCamp
          team organizes an <em>"unconference"</em> day following the conference where
          attendees will keep on sharing their knowledge and ideas in a less formal
          and more relax context, prone to creativity: the snowy slopes.</p>

        <h3 class="ui header">Why should you sponsor SnowCamp?</h3>
        <p>You need to recruit new talents,
          you want to set up or confirm your image in innovating communities, or
          spread the developers about your services and products; then the SnowCamp is the perfect opportunity!</p>

        <p>To make possible those 2 days of conferences and workshops (with 3
          parallel tracks, cumulating more than 30 presentations) with a very
          attractive price of 50 euros, your support is highly welcome.</p>

        <p>All you need to do is to say “yes” to one of the sponsoring packs we’re proposing.</p>

        <p>Note that the number of partnerships will be limited.</p>
